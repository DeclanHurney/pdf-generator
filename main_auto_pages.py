# Example
#  style='B' (bold) - check more styles here: https://www.fpdf.org/en/doc/setfont.htm
#  w=0: cell extends to the width of the document. Anything greater than 0 means you can play around with width
#  border=0 means that the cell is not wrapped with a border
#  ln=1 (break line): next cell appears on next line. ln=0: next cell will be added after width of current cell
#  h=12 means the height of the cell, it is best to keep it same height as the font
#  txt='Hello there!' means the content of the cell
#  align="L" means the alignment of the text within the cell
